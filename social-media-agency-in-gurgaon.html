                                understand a few things. Social media is a lot of things wrapped into one. It is a
                                content distribution platform, a content megaphone, a research and comparison tool, a
                                discovery and an awareness tool, a sales tool and an employee engagement tool as well as
                                a customer service channel. These many facets of social media makes it vitally important
                                for any business, since it creates multiple touchpoints for the target audience. In
                                order to leverage the benefits of social media marketing, a business needs to understand
                                what is social media’s role within the buyer’s journey. That is where Justwords comes
                                in.

                        When Justwords offers social media marketing services in Gurgaon, the approach is always to
                        understand the customer’s pain point and what is she looking for, and then use social media as a
                        medium to educate and build trust. In the process, we move the prospect or customer down the
                        customer’s journey of awareness to consideration to desire to purchase.

                                            closer to their goals. The main things done by a social media agency to

                                            posts <br> ● Designing visuals for the content like videos, GIFs, graphics,
                                            infographics, reels, etc <br> ● Publishing the posts <br> ● Carrying out

                                        <p>Hiring the best social media agency in Gurgaon or any city depends on the kind of budgets you have as well as the kind of marketing partner you want to work with. However, here are the basics that you should consider.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          <strong>1. What is your goal - </strong>For example, if your major goal is running paid advertisement campaigns, then you should be looking for an agency which is strong in performance marketing. However, if you are looking for organic and inorganic growth, and looking for skillsets in design, content, content marketing and paid marketing, then it is better to look for an agency that specialises in all those skills.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          <strong>2. What is your budget - </strong> Close on a budget you are comfortable with and then start shopping around for someone who is closer to what you can afford. While you will always get a cheap and affordable agency, focus on an agency which has experience in the skills sets you need.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          <strong>3. What is their Experience: </strong> Look at their portfolio of work, the industries they have worked in, the results they have achieved, the testimonials from clients, their work done on different social media accounts etc. A good social media agency will talk about strategy, the overall things needed to achieve the goals, and do an audit of the full website and provide overall recommendations as well.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          <strong>4. How do they work:</strong> Understand how do they work. During interviews, ask them questions in areas like capabilities, culture fit, communication, and commitment.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>This answer depends mostly on what is your requirement. Also, it will depend on whether you are hiring a small size agency or a large corporate agency. </p>
                                        <p>If you are a small business and looking for basic to moderate packages of social media marketing (which includes mostly content creation, visual design, strategy, marketing) then this should cost somewhere between Rs 25,000-Rs 45,000 (minus GST). This is ofcourse, not including paid ads marketing. </p>
                                        <p>If you are looking for advanced social media marketing packages that include content creation, design and graphics that include a variety of visual formats, ORM, content and social media marketing strategy, data analysis etc, then the package is likely to vary between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Again the final budget will depend on the number of visuals that have to be created, and the budget to boost your content, as well as your paid ad budget. </p>
